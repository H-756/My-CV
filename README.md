# My-CV
The objective is to create a CV webpage using HTML and CSS. The webpage should showcase your personality while remaining professional. 
The steps to follow are: Create an HTML page called index.html and add elements to create a webpage that acts as an online CV. Include a short bio, contact details, an image of yourself, a list of skills and competencies, and descriptions of your education, work experience, and projects. Add links to any blog posts or articles that you have written. Use CSS to style and position the elements attractively on your webpage. Create a link to it using Django.
